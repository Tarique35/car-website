                            Exterior Design 
                            
                            The new Audi A4 facelift is based on the B9 generation model that was unveiled back in 2016. Changes to the exterior design include an updated single-frame grille, refreshed front and rear bumpers, new matrix LED headlamps, and reworked tail lights.

                            Under the hood, the Audi A6 is limited to a petrol engine. The car gets a BS-VI emission compliant 2.0-litre petrol in the 45TFSI guise. This engine produces 245bhp/370Nm and is mated to a seven-speed S-Tronic transmission sending power to the front wheels.
                            
                            Exterior Design
                            
                            The exterior design on this new car is evolutionary but has moved from the rounded edges of the fourth generation A6 to a sharper and sportier design for this new car. We've taken a liking to the rather space age looking LED lighting package both in the front and rear and they do well to add to the car's futuristic appearance.
                            
                            Interior and Features
                            
                            The new Audi A6 is the first Audi in India to be offered with the dual touchscreen setup in the centre console. The upper screen runs Audi's latest MMI system while the lower screen does duty for the climate control and other functions. The car is the same length as the fourth generation model but inside there is more room. The cabin length is up by 21 mm, rear legroom by 17 mm, and there's more headroom - 8mm in front and 11 mm at the rear.

                            The A8 was the first car from the German automaker to debut their latest family design. Two major highlights of this family appearance are the HD Matrix LED headlamps with laser lights and the iconic Audi grille. The tail light is now a horizontal OLED-infused unit with a new signature motif while a special highlight of the A8 is the coupe-like smooth flowing sloping roofline that gives the luxury sedan a sporty appeal. Dimension wise, the new A8L measures 5,300mm in length, 1,955mm in width and 1,499mm in height.

                            On the inside, the A8's cabin is all-new. There is a brand-new MMI system with haptic feedback, the 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment screen dominates the centre dashboard and all the connected services the Ingolstadt carmaker has on offer. The leather upholstery, electrically controlled air-con vents, remote-controlled seat, ambient lighting, rear feet massage incorporated into the back of front-passenger seats. Also on offer is the rear-seat entertainment package that features two detachable tablets that can control various features in the car.
